To be completely honest, I had no particularly strong reasons to do a PhD. I in fact started it believing I would not finish. In the end, I picked based on gut, and my gut said that the PhD would be the most new and exciting possibility.

If I were to go back and re-justify my choice to myself, with the power of hindsight, I'd say I asked myself **"which option opens the most doors?"**

> Pick the option that opens the most doors.
